## Abstract

Compared to filmwise condensation on conventional condenser surfaces, heat transfer can be significantly enhanced by tuning the wettability of the surface to promote dropwise condensation. Following rapid advances in surface engineering, the last years have seen an unprecedented interest in dropwise condensation research. This brief review highlights recent advances in theory and experimental investigation regarding dropwise condensation on smooth hydrophobic surfaces, micro‐ and nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces, biphilic surfaces with patterned wettability, and lubricant‐infused surfaces.
