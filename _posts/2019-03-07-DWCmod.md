This post provides a first overview on emerging approaches for ML (machine learning) and the motivation behind learning ML.


## ML is all around us. Starting with

During the last decades there has been great progress in ML. NLP (Natural Language Processing), a category of ML, has made substantial [progress](https://ruder.io/tracking-progress-nlp/) in the past years.
Only five years ago the performance in key tasks stagnated and gaining [1pp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP_(complexity)) was considered a major success. Today almost all tasks gain +10pp. This is due to deep learning. The training of Deep learning, that is a category of ML, is based on word/sentence/character embeddings. It's models are collections of high dimensional vector spaces and there is no interpretation possible. It's a #'black box'.

## But what is a black box anyways? 

A Black Box Model is a framework that doesn't uncover its internal mechanisms. In ML, "black box" portrays models that can't be comprehended by taking a look at their parameters (for example a neural network). Something contrary to a black box is some of the time alluded to as White Box.

This tutorial blog is following along a scientific seminar on interpretable machine learning for the DH (Digital Humanities) at the University of Cologne.
