This post provides a first overview on emerging approaches for ML (machine learning) and the motivation behind learning ML.


## ML is all around us. Starting with

In the least complex sense, ML is a method of computer data analysis that learns from its own "experience". Once a machine learning algorithm recogize what specific patterns look like, it can apply the knowledge on a vast scale.

During the last decades there has been great progress in ML. NLP (Natural Language Processing), a category of ML, has made substantial [progress](https://ruder.io/tracking-progress-nlp/) in the past years.
Only five years ago the performance in key tasks stagnated and gaining [1pp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP_(complexity)) was considered a major success. Today almost all tasks gain +10pp. This is due to deep learning. The training of Deep learning, that is a category of ML, is based on word/sentence/character embeddings. It's models are collections of high dimensional vector spaces and there is no interpretation possible. It's a 'black box'.


## But what is a black box anyways? 

A Black Box Model is a framework that doesn't uncover its internal mechanisms. In ML, "black box" portrays models that can't be comprehended by taking a look at their parameters (for example a neural network). Something contrary to a black box is some of the time alluded to as White Box.

Ok, ok ... that's too much for the start. Check out the next page to find out about the essential terminology and what all those terms mean.
