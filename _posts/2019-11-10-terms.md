Before we get familiar with the elementary terminology of ML, I would briefly repeat what ML is. It's a range of methods that computers use to generate and enhance predictions or patterns of behavior based on data. There are three main learning methods.

![Methods](https://github.com/nashtash/learn_ml/blob/master/assets/blog/2019_11_10/Drawing.jpeg?raw=true){: .align-center}

Hi `$z = x + y$`.

`$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$`

`$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$`

**Supervised Machine Learning** - the objective of supervised learning is to acquire a predictive model that represents attributes of the data on an output (e.g. car price, house price).

**Unsupervised Learning** is where there's no particular output of special interest, rather a cluster of data points.

**Reinforcement Training** that's where an operative learns to optimize a certain reward by acting in an environment like a game with clear boundaries (e.g. a model playing Tetris).

If the **output** is categorical, the task is referred to as **classification**, and if it is numerical, it is called **regression**. The algorithm of Machine Learning learns a model by guessing parameters or learning patterns.


## Machine Learning is following a strict procedure plan with fixed steps

![process](https://github.com/nashtash/learn_ml/blob/master/assets/blog/2019_11_10/process.png?raw=true){: .align-center}


**1. Step**: Data collection. The more, the better. The data must contain the result to be predicted and additional information from which the prediction can be made. For a Credit Default Predictor, you need past data on actual loans, information on whether customers were in arrears with their loans, and data to help you make predictions, such as income, past credit defaults, etc. For an automatic home valuation program, you can collect data from past home sales and information about the property such as size, location, etc.
Step

**2. Step**: Enter this information into a machine learning algorithm that generates a character detector model, a credit rating model or a house value estimator.

**3. Step**: Use the model with new data. Integrate the model into a product or process, such as a self-propelled car, credit application process, or real estate marketplace website.

**You have probably heard that ML is often referred to as statistics and know this picture, which buzzes through social media.**

## In the following table, you can find a classification between the two disciplines and see how they differ from each other.




|Technique |Machine Learning |Statistics |
|---|---|---|
|Data handling|Works with big data in the form of networks and graphs; raw data from sensors or the web text is split into training and test data.|Models are used to create predictive power on small samples.|
|Data Input|The data is sampled, randomized, and transformed to maximize accuracy scoring in the prediction of out of sample (or completely new) examples.| Parameters interpret real-world phenomena and provide stress on magnitude.|
|Result|Probability is taken into account for comparing what could be the best guess or decision.|The output captures the variability and uncertainty of parameters.|
|Assumptions|The scientist learns from the data.|The scientist assumes a certain output and tries to prove it.|
|Distribution|The distribution is unknown or ignored before learning from data.|The scientist assumes a well-defined distribution.|
|Fitting|The scientist creates a best fit, but a generalizable, model.|The result is fit to the present data distribution.|

**Finally, here is the most important Machine Learning terminology that you'll come along during this tutorial.**

### Glossary

**Accuracy**
Percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

**Algorithm**
A method, function, or series of instructions used to generate a machine learning model. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.

**Attribute**
A quality describing an observation (e.g. color, size, weight). In Excel terms, these are column headers.

**Bias metric**
What is the average difference between your predictions and the correct value for that observation?
- **Low** bias could mean every prediction is correct. It could also mean half of your predictions are above their actual values and half are below, in equal proportion, resulting in a low average difference.
- **High bias** (with low variance) suggests your model may be underfitting and you’re using the wrong architecture for the job.

**Bias term**
Allow models to represent patterns that do not pass through the origin. For example, if all my features were 0, would my output also be zero? Is it possible there is some base value upon which my features affect? Bias terms typically accompany weights and are attached to neurons or filters.

**Categorical Variables**
Variables with a discrete set of possible values. It can be ordinal (order matters) or nominal (order doesn’t matter).

**Classification**
Predicting a categorical output.
- **Binary classification** predicts one of two possible outcomes (e.g. is the email spam or not spam?)
- **Multi-class classification** predicts one of multiple possible outcomes (e.g. is this a photo of a cat, dog, horse or human?)

**Classification Threshold**
The lowest probability value at which we’re comfortable asserting a positive classification. For example, if the predicted probability of being diabetic is > 50%, return True, otherwise return False.

**Clustering**
Unsupervised grouping of data into buckets.

**Confusion Matrix**
Table that describes the performance of a classification model by grouping predictions into 4 categories.
- **True Positives**: we correctly predicted they do have diabetes
- **True Negatives**: we correctly predicted they don’t have diabetes
- **False Positives**: we incorrectly predicted they do have diabetes (Type I error)
- **False Negatives**: we incorrectly predicted they don’t have diabetes (Type II error)

**Continuous Variables**
Variables with a range of possible values defined by a number scale (e.g. sales, lifespan).

**Convergence**
A state reached during the training of a model when the loss changes very little between each iteration.

**Deduction**
A top-down approach to answering questions or solving problems. A logic technique that starts with a theory and tests that theory with observations to derive a conclusion. E.g. We suspect X, but we need to test our hypothesis before coming to any conclusions.

**Deep Learning**
Deep Learning is derived from one machine learning algorithm called perceptron or multi layer perceptron that gain more and more attention nowadays because of its success in different fields like, computer vision to signal processing and medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. As all other AI algorithms deep learning is from decades, but now today we have more and more data and cheap computing power that make this algorithm really powerful to achieve state of the art accuracy. In modern world this algorithm knowns as an artificial neural network. deep learning is much more than traditional artificial neural network. But it was highly influenced by machine learning’s neural network and perceptron network.

**Dimension**
Dimention for machine learning and data scientist is differ from physics, here Dimention of data means how much feature you have in you data ocean(data-set). e.g in case of object detection application, flatten image size and color channel(e.g 28*28*3) is a feature of the input set. In case of house price prediction (maybe) house size is the data-set so we call it 1 dimentional data.

**Epoch**
An epoch describes the number of times the algorithm sees the entire data set.

**Extrapolation**
Making predictions outside the range of a dataset. E.g. My dog barks, so all dogs must bark. In machine learning we often run into trouble when we extrapolate outside the range of our training data.

**False Positive Rate**
Defined as
$$P_\omega={n_\omega\over 2}\hbar\omega\,{1+R\over 1-v^2}\int\limits_{-1}^{1}dx\,(x-v)|x-v|,$$
The False Positive Rate forms the x-axis of the ROC curve.

**Feature**
With respect to a dataset, a feature represents an attribute and value combination. Color is an attribute. “Color is blue” is a feature. In Excel terms, features are similar to cells. The term feature has other definitions in different contexts.

**Feature Selection**
Feature selection is the process of selecting relevant features from a data-set for creating a Machine Learning model.

**Feature Vector**
A list of features describing an observation with multiple attributes. In Excel we call this a row.

**Hyperparameters**
Hyperparameters are higher-level properties of a model such as how fast it can learn (learning rate) or complexity of a model. The depth of trees in a Decision Tree or number of hidden layers in a Neural Networks are examples of hyper parameters.

**Induction**
A bottoms-up approach to answering questions or solving problems. A logic technique that goes from observations to theory. E.g. We keep observing X, so we infer that Y must be True.

**Instance**
A data point, row, or sample in a dataset. Another term for observation.

**Label**
The “answer” portion of an observation in supervised learning. For example, in a dataset used to classify flowers into different species, the features might include the petal length and petal width, while the label would be the flower’s species.

**Learning Rate**
The size of the update steps to take during optimization loops like Gradient Descent. With a high learning rate we can cover more ground each step, but we risk overshooting the lowest point since the slope of the hill is constantly changing. With a very low learning rate, we can confidently move in the direction of the negative gradient since we are recalculating it so frequently. A low learning rate is more precise, but calculating the gradient is time-consuming, so it will take us a very long time to get to the bottom.

**Loss**
Loss = true_value(from data-set)- predicted value(from ML-model) The lower the loss, the better a model (unless the model has over-fitted to the training data). The loss is calculated on training and validation and its interpretation is how well the model is doing for these two sets. Unlike accuracy, loss is not a percentage. It is a summation of the errors made for each example in training or validation sets.

**Machine Learning**
Mitchell (1997) provides a succinct definition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.” In simple language machine learning is a field in which human made algorithms have an ability learn by itself or predict future for unseen data.

**Model**
A data structure that stores a representation of a dataset (weights and biases). Models are created/learned when you train an algorithm on a dataset.

**Neural Networks**
Neural Networks are mathematical algorithms modeled after the brain’s architecture, designed to recognize patterns and relationships in data.

**Normalization**
Restriction of the values of weights in regression to avoid overfitting and improving computation speed.

**Noise**
Any irrelevant information or randomness in a dataset which obscures the underlying pattern.

**Null Accuracy**
Baseline accuracy that can be achieved by always predicting the most frequent class (“B has the highest frequency, so lets guess B every time”).

**Observation**
A data point, row, or sample in a dataset. Another term for instance.

**Outlier**
An observation that deviates significantly from other observations in the dataset.

**Overfitting**
Overfitting occurs when your model learns the training data too well and incorporates details and noise specific to your dataset. You can tell a model is overfitting when it performs great on your training/validation set, but poorly on your test set (or new real-world data).

**Parameters**
Parameters are properties of training data learned by training a machine learning model or classifier. They are adjusted using optimization algorithms and unique to each experiment.
Examples of parameters include:
- weights in an artificial neural network
- support vectors in a support vector machine
- coefficients in a linear or logistic regression

**Precision**
In the context of binary classification (Yes/No), precision measures the model’s performance at classifying positive observations (i.e. “Yes”). In other words, when a positive value is predicted, how often is the prediction correct? We could game this metric by only returning positive for the single observation we are most confident in.

P=TruePositivesTruePositives+FalsePositives

**Recall**
Also called sensitivity. In the context of binary classification (Yes/No), recall measures how “sensitive” the classifier is at detecting positive instances. In other words, for all the true observations in our sample, how many did we “catch.” We could game this metric by always classifying observations as positive.

R=TruePositivesTruePositives+FalseNegatives

**Recall vs Precision**
Say we are analyzing Brain scans and trying to predict whether a person has a tumor (True) or not (False). We feed it into our model and our model starts guessing.

- Precision is the % of True guesses that were actually correct! If we guess 1 image is True out of 100 images and that image is actually True, then our precision is 100%! Our results aren’t helpful however because we missed 10 brain tumors! We were super precise when we tried, but we didn’t try hard enough.
- Recall, or Sensitivity, provides another lens which with to view how good our model is. Again let’s say there are 100 images, 10 with brain tumors, and we correctly guessed 1 had a brain tumor. Precision is 100%, but recall is 10%. Perfect recall requires that we catch all 10 tumors!

**Regression**
Predicting a continuous output (e.g. price, sales).

**Regularization**
Regularization is a technique utilized to combat the overfitting problem. This is achieved by adding a complexity term to the loss function that gives a bigger loss for more complex models

**Reinforcement Learning**
Training a model to maximize a reward via iterative trial and error.

**ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve**
A plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate at all classification thresholds. This is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model at different classification thresholds. The area under the ROC curve can be interpreted as the probability that the model correctly distinguishes between a randomly chosen positive observation (e.g. “spam”) and a randomly chosen negative observation (e.g. “not spam”).

**Segmentation**
Contribute a definition!

**Specificity**
In the context of binary classification (Yes/No), specificity measures the model’s performance at classifying negative observations (i.e. “No”). In other words, when the correct label is negative, how often is the prediction correct? We could game this metric if we predict everything as negative.

S=TrueNegativesTrueNegatives+FalsePositives

**Supervised Learning**
Training a model using a labeled dataset.

**Test Set**
A set of observations used at the end of model training and validation to assess the predictive power of your model. How generalizable is your model to unseen data?

**Training Set**
A set of observations used to generate machine learning models.

**Transfer Learning**
A machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. In transfer learning, we take the pre-trained weights of an already trained model (one that has been trained on millions of images belonging to 1000’s of classes, on several high power GPU’s for several days) and use these already learned features to predict new classes.

**True Positive Rate**
Another term for recall, i.e.

TPR=TruePositivesTruePositives+FalseNegatives
The True Positive Rate forms the y-axis of the ROC curve.

**Type 1 Error**
False Positives. Consider a company optimizing hiring practices to reduce false positives in job offers. A type 1 error occurs when a candidate seems good and they hire him, but he is actually bad.

**Type 2 Error**
False Negatives. The candidate was great but the company passed on him.

**Underfitting**
Underfitting occurs when your model over-generalizes and fails to incorporate relevant variations in your data that would give your model more predictive power. You can tell a model is underfitting when it performs poorly on both training and test sets.

**Universal Approximation Theorem**
A neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function but only for inputs in a specific range. If you train a network on inputs between -2 and 2, then it will work well for inputs in the same range, but you can’t expect it to generalize to other inputs without retraining the model or adding more hidden neurons.

**Unsupervised Learning**
Training a model to find patterns in an unlabeled dataset (e.g. clustering).

**Validation Set**
A set of observations used during model training to provide feedback on how well the current parameters generalize beyond the training set. If training error decreases but validation error increases, your model is likely overfitting and you should pause training.

**Variance**
How tightly packed are your predictions for a particular observation relative to each other?
- Low variance suggests your model is internally consistent, with predictions varying little from each other after every iteration.
- High variance (with low bias) suggests your model may be overfitting and reading too deeply into the noise found in every training set.

**WoW** you made it all the way down here, Congrats! In the next post, we'll start to push some code! So get R ready to take off 8-)
