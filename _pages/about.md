I'm a researcher/PhD student at the TU Dresden [Institute of Process Engineering and Environmental Technology](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/maschinenwesen/ifvu). My research is focused on enhancing heat transfer via functionalized surfaces with special wettability. 

As a researcher, I have worked on projects about dropwise condensation of water/steam, fouling resistant heat exchanger surfaces, and energy optimization of industrial processes.

My current research project explores dropwise condensation of non-aqueous fluids. It is based on functionalized surfaces described in my latest paper: [Electrodeposited metal-organic framework films as self-assembled hierarchically superstructured supports for stable omniphobic surface coatings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33542-4).
