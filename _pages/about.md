I'm a data journalist and M.A. student at the [University of Cologne](https://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=9441&L=1). My research is focused on the intersection of Digital Humanities (DH) and Eastern European History (EEH). 

This blog pursues the idea of making Machine Learning easily accessible to many. We will mainly work with the programming language R in the environment of Rstudio. 
Here you can [download the software](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
