I'm a data journalist and M.A. student at the [University of Cologne](https://www.portal.uni-koeln.de/index.php?id=9441&L=1) and the [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) in Moscow. My research is focused on the intersection between Digital Humanities (DH) and Eastern European History (EEH). 

This blog pursues the idea of making Machine Learning easily accessible to many. It follows along a scientific course held at UzK. We will mainly work with the programming language R in the environment of Rstudio. 
Here you can [download the software](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and under this link you can download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
